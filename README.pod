=head1 NAME

Encode::Arabic::Franco - Turns Franco-/Chat-Arabic into actual Arabic letters


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Encode::Arabic::Franco;

    while ($line = <>) {
        print decode 'franco-arabic', $line;   # 'Franco-Arabic' alias 'Arabizy'
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Franco-Arabic, aka Chat Arabic, Arabizy, is a transliteration of Arabic, commonly used on the internet. It restricts itself to the ASCII charset and substitutes numbers for the Arabic characters which have no equivalent in Latin.

Franco-Arabic is not standardized. This module is far from complete.


=head2 IMPLEMENTATION

Currently nothing more than a chain of C<tr>icks à la:

    $str =~ s/3'/غ/g;
    $str =~ s/7'/خ/g;
